Getting familiar with Rust by following a roguelike tutorial.

Questions:
    What is a stuct?
    Is struct like an object?
    Do you have to create the struct then create the code to create the struct in the actual code?
    Does `mut` mean mutable?
    What is `blit` Is it tcod or Rust?
    What is `impl`?
    What's going on with the `&`? Is that a pointer?
